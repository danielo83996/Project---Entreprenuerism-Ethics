As our company begins to grow at a rapid rate, we will need to ensure our consumers that this company is able to follow a simple but effective ethical code. 
Our ethical policy will be broken up into six core items: efficiency, impact, moral code, reliability, security, and privacy. A main key to guaranteeing our success 
is being able to properly understand the importance of a strong ethical code. It is a must that we uphold this ethical code for our consumers and follow those core items
within our policy. Security and privacy are essential to consumers of our company; this is the base of technological ethics, and we must be able to ensure safety and
protection for our users. This includes ways to ensure that we do not access or leak user information and that our product is safe and reliable to use. Reliability is a
key factor, as we want our consumers to be able to use our product frequently and only expect the best with no errors concerning our product. Another code we will follow
is the ability to prove that our product is efficient and what makes our product unique and stand out above other products within our competition. We want our product to
be able to prove the impact that it will have on consumers and the technological market and to lead to further innovation in the future years of our company.

With our company, we plan to hire only the best leaders of the tech industry to be able to provide a strong relationship with our consumers, continuous innovative 
concepts, fresh new designs, improved manufacturing, and a resilient business strategy. Our three picks for our board are Marc Benioff, Jeff Bezos, and Tim Cook. Marc 
Benioff is one of the most influential leaders when it comes to customer interactions and data. He is the founder, chairman, and CEO of the software company Salesforce. 
Salesforce is a customer-relationship cloud-based software designed to focus on customer service, e-commerce, sales, and analytics. Besides Marc Benioff’s background in 
computer science, we plan to use his entrepreneurial skills to better our company’s customer engagement. From this, we will have a better idea of how to promote our 
product to consumers, understand our customers’ wants and needs, and establish a long-lasting relationship with them. Jeff Bezos is an immediate person that comes to 
mind when it comes to success in the field of technology and e-commerce. Jeff Bezos is the founder, former president, and CEO of Amazon. Amazon is an online retailer 
and web service provider that sells goods such as books, movies, music, electronics, apparel, beauty products, health products, automotive products, and many more. 
Jeff Bezos claims endless innovation and creativity to be key factors to his success. This can be seen with his constant improvement in Amazon’s AI, cloud computing, 
Amazon Web Services, and the virtual assistant, Alexa. Applying this mindset to our own product will allow room for constant growth in the future. Apple is the 
world’s largest technology company in terms of revenue; they are most well known for their smartphones, tablets, personal computers, wearable devices, and software. 
Tim Cook is the current CEO of Apple, and we would like to use his knowledge of manufacturing and business strategy for our product. Apple’s competitive edge in the 
field of electronics clearly shows the dominance that Apple products have over many of their competitors. This comes from a strong business strategy in which they are 
able to differentiate their product and appeal to all kinds of consumers. In addition, Apple is one of the top companies in manufacturing its products successfully 
and efficiently. We would like to utilize these ideas from Tim Cook, as we believe having him as a member of our board would greatly improve the manufacturing and 
appeal of our product.
