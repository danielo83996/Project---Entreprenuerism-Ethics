# Project---Entreprenuerism-Ethics
# This project examines the practice of Ethics in modern startup and entreprenuerial acitivites. Your group will form a fictious company creating a feasible/real # # # technology product or service. You will develop the 4 items below that will discuss not only the fundamental concept behind your company and its founders (your group) but, highlight its Culture and this is the main page for the company [insert name]

Item 1 : Business Plan

A. Company Name: Intranet Infrasture Solutions DBA Formerly WorkstationGPT

B. Long Term Vision Statement:

What are our goals?
Our goals is to develop an application for IT Administrators to use to solve real world problems, but also for everyday applications for anyone that needs it. 
The application can also be used by everyday users to quickly solve simple or complex issues without the need to bring their workstation to a repair shop, 
call tech support for simple things, and even allow OEM Manufacters to focus on what they do best - building more workstations for the general market.

Where did our idea come from?
Most IT Administartors are taught through memory without the compasitity to remember the basic fundementals of why this occured in the first place or to think of 
complex solutions when a more simpler solution does solve the current issue at hand. It comes along something like having a computer science mentor at your fingertips.

What is the purpose, values and mission?
Empower IT professionals to solve issues on multiple workstations faster and get unstuck easily. The Application can redude tickets by solving most simple issues through guidance and instruction therough the development of WorkstationGPT (propritary code) and incoprate real time feedback into the application.

How can our startup have an impact?
Tech support agents does not have to spend time fixing simple issues, on environments where there is thousands of workstations at a time or just a computer illerate user, this application can reduce costs easily by flagging issues that arise before the end user has to submit a ticket, and guide on how to fix a complex problem.

What engages our passions?
The ITS in most companies and settings are slow to respond to a lot of issues, and gets overwhelmed to solve issues that arise easily, or all at once.
Fix that, reduce their costs, so the savings can be passed on to IIS (WorkstationGPT) to further improve development.


C. External opportunities that exist:
Anyone that is using a computer, laptop, Workstation, or Desktop would like assistance from our application when it is accessible, 
Anyone managing thousands of workstations can use our enterprise tiers to monitor each workstations for issues before they become a problem
and easily remedy those by posting them on the application for further action or fixing them automatically. Can also stop easy insider threats. 
Revenue can be generated easily through our pricing tiers, (Free Pool), (Tech Support Pool), or Enterprise Pool) per user.

Item 4 : Experimentation & Priorities

A. Experimentation

In order to innovate:

We need to analyze our competition and find out the strengths of our competitors’ line of products and what sets them apart. We
would have to compile the data of the technical trends of our peers’ products: processing power, energy usage, cost of materials,
weight, latency, etcetera. Aggregate the complaints levied at these kinds of products and what problems that our industry faces
when creating smart glasses Learn about breakthroughs in industries and fields related to ours, such as [INSERT TEXT HERE],
and find ways to incorporate them into making a prototype. Put together all our research and put it into creating a prototype
that would fulfill our criteria for a product that outperforms the previous iterations and adds more features.
In order to develop a strong brand:

We need to figure out which demographics are interested in [INSERT TEXT HERE] and which would benefit from [INSERT TEXT HERE].
Get focus testing for our products asking similar questions as before. Reach out to influencers to help advertise our products
by [INSERT TEXT HERE]. Team up with advertising companies that specialize in internet advertising and
create an ad or series of ads in order that would make our company’s name and products easy to recall, something easy to parody.

We need to learn about which retailers our customers are buying from, both online and in-person, and have special
deals with said retailers which provides extra and unique items.
Team up with other franchises, such as video games or television shows, to create special branded versions of our products
and put them through one of our partnered retailers. Provide services or subscriptions to services related to our smart
glasses, like a free year of [INSERT TEXT HERE]. Find out which countries purchase our products from overseas and
make sure to set up lines of distribution with them in order to help cut down costs for imports. Make sure that there is
always a ready surplus of product and identify problems within the supply chain and where delays occur. Avoid having Just-In-Time
scheduling for [INSERT TEXT HERE].

B. Priorities:

Conduct market research.
Secure funding for our project.
Develop a production plan.
Establish a legal entity.
Create a viable product that lets us stand out in the market.
